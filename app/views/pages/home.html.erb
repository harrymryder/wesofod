    <h1>The Welfare Society for the Disabled</h1>
    <p>
      WESOFOD is a community-based NGO run by and for people with disabilities. We fight for the <strong>rights of disabled people</strong> and for the children under our care. In Sierra Leone, children are left out of school because of their disability or background. We give these forgotten children a school, a home, and a future. We ask these children to <strong>focus on their abilities</strong>, not their disabilities.
